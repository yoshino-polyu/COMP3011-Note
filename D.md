Dear Professor Reynold,

Thank you for taking time to consider me! I think it is important to work on a topic/area that will remain relevant (e.g., HPC, GPU computer arch) after my graduate and align well with my strengths and passions. 

After seeking for potential phd advisors for this application semester, I have found an advisor who can help me achieve my goals. 
already find an suitable advisor. 
thank you for you taking time to consider me. 

Regards,
Simon



Dear Professor Reynold,

I really want to thank you for the time you invested in considering my application for your PhD position! Grateful to have opportunity to discuss potential research directions with you and your willingness to see how my background in GPU computer architecture and algorithms might intersect with your expertise in knowledge graph.

After careful consideration, I have decided to pursue a PhD with a professor whose research focus aligns more closely with my interests and strengths. I think it is important to work on an area that will remain relevant after my graduate and continue to do something that I really love. I believe this decision will allow me to contribute more effectively and grow in my chosen field. Your insights and advice during our discussions were invaluable in helping me reach this conclusion.

Thank you again for your understanding and support!

Merry Christmas & Happy New Year,
Simon



我想写一封信给我之前phd陶瓷过的 Professor Reynold 告诉他感谢他之前花时间考虑我的申请, 同时也告诉他我找到了更加合适我的老师. 之前他花了不少时间和我联系问我愿不愿意去他那读phd, 但是我的方向(GPU computer architecture)和他的方向(data algorithms & ai algorithms) 不是很匹配 (not very familiar). 下面这一段是他之前的回复. 于是在这个phd申请季我就没有再找他尽管他很好, 但是我感觉他和我不是很适配. 

I need more time to find out your potential and interest. Maybe can find a topic to do a “mini-research” so that we can see if we fit each other. I’m looking for a student who is technically accomplished and interested in data algorithms. Your strength looks to be in GPU hardware topics which could be interesting to algorithm development (but I’m not very familiar).  Perhaps you can tell me more about what you think you can do well in PhD.

BTW, are you interested in MPhil? Note that it can be converted to PhD in the middle of the study.

Best Regards,
Reynold

请你学习下面这几封邮件里面的 arguments, rationale, 以及措辞来帮我写给 Reynold 的感谢信. 
Hello Xuan,
I think your resume looks very strong. Finding anadvisor who can help you achieve your goals iskey. lt's equally important to work on a topic thatwill remain relevant after you graduate and alignwell with your strengths and passions. PhDeducation isn't just about writing papers; it's atransformative human experience that helps usgrow. i'm confident you'll have many fantasticoptions.Sometimes we focus too much on whatothers expect from us to get in, rather than onwhat we need to become better individuals.Prioritizing the latter will help you make a betterlong-term decision.
You should try every school that you aim for.You will be very surprised by what you canachieve now and in the long run if you aimat your career goal. Of course, you can alwaysapply to and come back to NYU as an option.
Best regards,

My advice to all students is not to look atgeographic location, not to look at school, butchoose by the advisor. Choose the advisorwhose topic fits you the most, choose theadvisor that will care about you, enable you andmake sure that your life as a PhD student isboth pleasant and successful. Choose by thecolleagues you will have in the lab. Choose bythe resources you will have in the lab,
