## Greedy Stays Ahead
Technique used in proving the correctness of greedy algorithms. 
Core idea: inductively prove under some measure, partial solutions produced by greedy algorithm "stay ahead" of partial solutions produced by any other algorithm. Then goes on to show final solution produced by greedy algorithm is ahead of any other solution. => greedy algorithm is the optimal solution.
