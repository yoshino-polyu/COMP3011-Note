Each person has a strictly ordered preference list containing all members of opposite sex. 
A matching = a set of ordered man-woman pairs. 
M = one-one correspondence between men and women.

## Check stability
It suffices to consider each member of one sex, say the men, as a potential member of a blocking pair.

## Gale-Shapley Theorem
There always exists at least one stable matching in an instance of the stable marriage problem. 
with Gale-Shapley algorithm, we can always find a stable matching.
